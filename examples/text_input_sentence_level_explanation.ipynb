    "In this demo, we compute sentence-level explanations for the Huggingface [`textattack/albert-base-v2-yelp-polarity`](https://huggingface.co/textattack/albert-base-v2-yelp-polarity) model, which is designed to perform sentiment analysis on paragraph-long reviews. If you come from the previous \"NLP - Word\" tutorial on computing word-level explanations (no worries if not), you may have realized that this problem could be solved by manually \"sentencizing\" the input text and defining each \"sentence\" as a \"word.\" However, in this demo, we introduce the `TextSentenceMasker` class which handles this sentencization automatically, using the `spacy` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first load required packages and the ALBERT model. Two classes are needed to compute the explanations. `BeamSearchExplainer` implements the beam search algorithm, and `*Masker` implements the feature masking. In this demo, we use `TextSentenceMasker` since we need to mask out individual sentences from a text input. The other demos showcase other `*Maskers`."

    "The explainer expects the function to be explained in a particular format. Specifically, it takes in a list of `N` (full or masked) inputs, and returns a `numpy` array of shape `N x C` where `C` is the number of classes. The values of the array can be anything, but most commonly the class probability, which is what we are going to do here. In addition, when masking features (i.e., sentences) from a piece of text, `TextWordMasker` takes the text as a string and returns another string. Thus, `texts` is a list of strings."
